# SkillPilot for ChatGPT Desktop — beta Git marketplace

This repository distributes **SkillPilot Coach v1** with its coaching skill and
remote SkillPilot MCP connection. The current package is **1.1.1**. This beta
uses the desktop plugin installer; it has no published OpenAI Directory listing.
ChatGPT web and native mobile operation have not been accepted.

## Install in ChatGPT Desktop

In the Windows desktop app:

1. Open **Plugins → Hinzufügen → Marketplace hinzufügen**.
2. Add `https://github.com/enpasos/skillpilot-chatgpt-marketplace`.
3. Select the marketplace **skillpilot-chatgpt-marketplace** and install
   **SkillPilot Coach v1**. Check the installed version.
4. Connect SkillPilot using the plugin's authentication flow. Use **Auto** or
   **CIMD** if the desktop asks for a registration method; no client secret is
   supplied by the tester.
5. Open [SkillPilot](https://skillpilot.com/), complete the learning setup,
   select **ChatGPT Desktop (Beta)** and generate its start message.
6. Copy that message into a **new desktop chat** with the SkillPilot plugin
   enabled. Keep the included learning session unchanged.

Until the updated provider choice is deployed, open
[the ChatGPT test start](https://skillpilot.com/?chatgptTest=1), select
**ChatGPT ausprobieren** and **Startnachricht erzeugen**. This already uses
the OpenAI launch endpoint; use its message in the new desktop chat.

Claude and ChatGPT have separate learning sessions. A message generated for
Claude cannot start the ChatGPT coach. Keep learning-session capabilities out
of public issues and screenshots.

The owner has installed the archive in Windows ChatGPT Desktop. Git installation,
OAuth, an actual context-tool call and a complete learning turn still need to be
recorded for that desktop host and candidate. An installed package alone does
not prove successful learning.

## Update

Use the marketplace's refresh/update action in ChatGPT Desktop, check that
**1.1.1** is installed, then start a new chat with a freshly generated ChatGPT
message. Existing archive installations need a Git-marketplace installation to
receive Git updates. Avoid enabling two SkillPilot copies in one chat.

For a supported Codex CLI in the same native environment:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/enpasos/skillpilot-chatgpt-marketplace --ref main
codex plugin add skillpilot-coach-v1@skillpilot-chatgpt-marketplace
codex plugin marketplace upgrade skillpilot-chatgpt-marketplace
```

Local tests with Codex **0.160.0** verified installation, skill discovery and
Git-delivered replacement of the installed files. They do not establish desktop
automatic updates. Windows native and WSL installations can have separate
configuration roots.

## Connection and integrity

The MCP endpoint remains `https://mcp-coach-v1.skillpilot.com/mcp`. Desktop
CIMD uses the separately pinned public OAuth profile with S256 PKCE; hosted
confidential OAuth remains separate. Valid OAuth and an independent
provider-specific learning session are required. Initial transport testing
permits mTLS `observe`; this package does not change server settings.

`release-manifest.json` binds every distributed file by SHA-256. From a source
checkout, run `node validate.mjs` to verify the closed inventory. This proves
package integrity, not host acceptance. Preserve every published release tag;
Git beta releases have a separate lifecycle from OpenAI portal publication.
